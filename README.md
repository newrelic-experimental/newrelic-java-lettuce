# New Relic Java Instrumentation for Lettuce Redis Driver

Instrumentation for the Lettuce driver for Redis (https://lettuce.io).   Once installed it will report the Lettuce calls to Redis as database calls in the New Relic Java Agent.

## Installation

To install:   
1. Download the latest release jar files.    
2. In the New Relic Java directory (the one containing newrelic.jar), create a directory named extensions if it does not already exist.   
3. Copy the downloaded jars into the extensions directory.   
4. Restart the application.   
   
## Getting Started

In the New Relic UI, the calls will show up under the Database tab for the application.   As well it will show up in transaction traces and distributed traces.

## Building

To build the extension jars from source, follow these steps:
### Build single extension

1. Set an environment variable *NEW_RELIC_EXTENSIONS_DIR* and set its value to the directory where you want the jar file built.
2. Run the command: gradlew *extension*:clean *extension*:install
### Build all extensions
To build all extensions, do the following:
1. Set an environment variable *NEW_RELIC_EXTENSIONS_DIR* and set its value to the directory where you want the jar file built.
2. Run the command: gradlew clean install
